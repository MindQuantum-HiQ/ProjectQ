    A sum of terms acting on qubits, e.g., 0.5 * 'X0 X5' + 0.3 * 'Z1 Z2'.

    A term is an operator acting on n qubits and can be represented as:

    coefficent * local_operator[0] x ... x local_operator[n-1]

    where x is the tensor product. A local operator is a Pauli operator ('I', 'X', 'Y', or 'Z') which acts on one
    qubit. In math notation a term is, for example, 0.5 * 'X0 X5', which means that a Pauli X operator acts on qubit 0
    and 5, while the identity operator acts on all other qubits.

    A QubitOperator represents a sum of terms acting on qubits and overloads operations for easy manipulation of these
    objects by the user.

    Note for a QubitOperator to be a Hamiltonian which is a hermitian operator, the coefficients of all terms must be
    real.

    .. code-block:: python

        hamiltonian = 0.5 * QubitOperator('X0 X5') + 0.3 * QubitOperator('Z0')

    Our Simulator takes a hermitian QubitOperator to directly calculate the expectation value (see
    Simulator.get_expectation_value) of this observable.

    A hermitian QubitOperator can also be used as input for the TimeEvolution gate.

    If the QubitOperator is unitary, i.e., it contains only one term with a coefficient, whose absolute value is 1,
    then one can apply it directly to qubits:

    .. code-block:: python

        eng = projectq.MainEngine()
        qureg = eng.allocate_qureg(6)
        QubitOperator('X0 X5', 1.j) | qureg # Applies X to qubit 0 and 5 with an additional global phase of 1.j


    Attributes:
        terms (dict): **key**: A term represented by a tuple containing all non-trivial local Pauli operators ('X',
                      'Y', or 'Z').  A non-trivial local Pauli operator is specified by a tuple with the first element
                      being an integer indicating the qubit on which a non-trivial local operator acts and the second
                      element being a string, either 'X', 'Y', or 'Z', indicating which non-trivial Pauli operator
                      acts on that qubit. Examples: ((1, 'X'),) or ((1, 'X'), (4,'Z')) or the identity ().  The tuples
                      representing the non-trivial local terms are sorted according to the qubit number they act on,
                      starting from 0.  **value**: Coefficient of this term as a (complex) float
    """

    def __init__(self, term=None, coefficient=1.0):  # pylint: disable=too-many-branches
        """
        Initialize a QubitOperator object.

        The init function only allows to initialize one term. Additional terms have to be added using += (which is
        fast) or using + of two QubitOperator objects:

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                ham = ((QubitOperator('X0 Y3', 0.5)
                        + 0.6 * QubitOperator('X0 Y3')))
                # Equivalently
                ham2 = QubitOperator('X0 Y3', 0.5)
                ham2 += 0.6 * QubitOperator('X0 Y3')

        Note:
            Adding terms to QubitOperator is faster using += (as this is done by in-place addition). Specifying the
            coefficient in the __init__ is faster than by multiplying a QubitOperator with a scalar as calls an
            out-of-place multiplication.

        Args:
            coefficient (complex float, optional): The coefficient of the first term of this QubitOperator. Default is
                1.0.
            term (optional, empy tuple, a tuple of tuples, or a string):
                1) Default is None which means there are no terms in the QubitOperator hence it is the "zero" Operator
                2) An empty tuple means there are no non-trivial Pauli operators acting on the qubits hence only
                   identities with a coefficient (which by default is 1.0).
                3) A sorted tuple of tuples. The first element of each tuple is an integer indicating the qubit on
                   which a non-trivial local operator acts, starting from zero. The second element of each tuple is a
                   string, either 'X', 'Y' or 'Z', indicating which local operator acts on that qubit.
                4) A string of the form 'X0 Z2 Y5', indicating an X on qubit 0, Z on qubit 2, and Y on qubit 5. The
                   string should be sorted by the qubit number. '' is the identity.
